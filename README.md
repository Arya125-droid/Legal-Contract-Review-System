# 🧠 AI-Based Legal Contract Review System

An AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to automatically analyze legal contracts, identify important clauses, and highlight them in the original PDF. The system uses a fine-tuned BERT model on the [CUAD](https://github.com/TheAtticusProject/cuad) dataset and provides a web-based Streamlit interface for easy upload and clause review.

## 📌 Features

- 📄 Upload and annotate legal contracts in PDF format.
- 🤖 Automatically classify clauses into legal categories:
  - Termination
  - Confidentiality
  - Dispute Resolution
  - Jurisdiction
- ✍️ Highlights clauses in the original PDF using PyMuPDF.
- 🌐 Streamlit UI for a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- 🧾 Download the annotated PDF.
- 📋 Displays top 3 predicted clause types per block (optional).
- 📂 Lists all extracted clauses and their predicted labels.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshuman125/Legal-Contract-Review-System.git
cd Legal-Contract-Review-System
```


### 2. Download the CUAD Dataset
To fine-tune or retrain the model, download the CUAD dataset from the official repo:

🔗 [CUAD Dataset GitHub](https://github.com/TheAtticusProject/cuad)

Place the dataset (cuad.json, etc.) in a data/ directory.


### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the key packages:
```bash
pip install transformers streamlit fitz tqdm scikit-learn torch
```


### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


### ⚠️ Note on Model Files
Due to GitHub's 100 MB file limit, the fine-tuned model (pytorch_model.bin or model.safetensors) is not included in this repo.

👉 To run the app:

- Download the trained model or fine-tune it using the CUAD dataset.
- Save it to ./legal-bert-cuad/.


### Model Training Info

- Fine-tuned bert-base-uncased on CUAD clause labels.
- Used HuggingFace Trainer.
- Trained for 3 epochs on MPS (Apple Silicon) — slower than CUDA.
- Evaluation: Macro F1-Score ~0.88 on unseen contract test set.
